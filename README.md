# InstaKobo

Read your Instapaper articles on your Kobo device.

## What's this?

I wanted to read my Instapaper articles on my Kobo devices, and there's nothing there that did what I wanted, so I created these scripts to help me do that. It's tailored to my workflow:

* Generate a KEPUB for each article on my Kobo's Dropbox folder.
* Download some articles on my Kobo, optionally manually adding them to the Instapaper collection. Optionally, if you use Dropbox just for Instapaper articles (like I do), you can use the Dropbox filter to see only your articles.
* Read them, add highlights.
* Sync the read progress and highlights to Instapaper (which then are synced into Readwise, and exported into Roam or Markdown).  

## Features

* Generate a KEPUB or EPUB for each article saved.
* Sync progress and highlights to Instapaper.
* Archive read articles and remove them from the device.

## But there's already Pocket integration on Kobo

While true, the Pocket integration is too basic for me. I have around 500 articles saved nicely tagged, and the Pocket integration does not use tags. This is not the end of the world, but the fact that you can't highlight in Pocket articles is a deal breaker for me.
